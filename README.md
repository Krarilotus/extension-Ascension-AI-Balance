# Ascension AI Balance

A plugin designed to enhance the gameplay experience, specifically for AI battles and playing with AI opponents. This balance is inspired by the renowned multiplayer Ascension balance and follows these key principles:

- **Counterplay to Defensive Ranged Troops**: Create more strategic options to counter defensive ranged troops positioned on high ground.
- **Map Size Enhancement**: Increase the perceived map size by reducing the range of ranged units.
- **Reduced Ranged Damage**: Lower the damage from ranged attacks, fire, and area-of-effect (AOE) damage to troops.
- **Siege Engine Revamp**: Make siege engines more costly and powerful, focusing on their strength and concentration.
- **Game Progression Through Weapon Options**: Offer a balanced progression system with meaningful weapon upgrades.
- **Popularity System Overhaul**: Revise the popularity system to make each factor relevant and impactful.
- **Building Costs Adjustment**: Fine-tune the stone and iron costs for advanced buildings to ensure smooth game progression.
- **Goods Pricing Balance**: Adjust the pricing for goods based on their usefulness and role in the game.
- **Wall Strengthening**: Reinforce walls to make them more resistant to normal attacks.
- **Defined Unit Roles**: Assign clear roles to each unit (e.g., Pikemen as tanks, Knights for raids, Tunnelers for structure and wall destruction).
